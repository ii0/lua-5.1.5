Hi list.

I wonder how to profile memory usage. I have this application, a
content-based router that moves notifications and subscriptions trough a
p2p network. It's based around a socket server (LuaSocket based), and
keeps lots of tables for peer lists, loop detection, subscription
filters, and assorted stuff. The memory consumption fluctuates a lot
with usage patterns, and there are a few configuration parameters that
have a serious impact.
It's intended to be run on plain consumer-grade wireless routers
(WRT54GL's and such), so RAM consumption is an issue.
I've googled around and only found stuff related to pre-5.1 lua,and
wonder if there's an easy way to see what tables are consuming what.

Thanks in advance,

Jorge

As far as I know, there is no easy way to do this. A method I sometimes
use is to check the memory usage, dereference the table and all its
objects, and check memory usage again. This is of course destructive,
but for debugging purposes it gives a good idea of the memory used by a
table, if you keep in mind some internals about lua's bookkeeping.

Another method to give an rough estimation of the size would be to
recursively iterate the table, keeping count of the various objects you
encounter and adding up the memory of each object. You could do some
tests to determine the approximate size of various native lua objects,
and keeping in mind that strings are interned and only stored once and
that the numeric index of a table is always a power of two, you should
be able to get an idea of the size of a given table.

I have exactly the same problem with not having enough tools to view
memory usage (also in a server).

I found this a while ago, but have yet to try it:
http://jan.kneschke.de/projects/profiling-lua-with-kcachegrind

It might be worth a try, it looks good.

Matthew.

Thanks Luiz (and of course Alexandra...) I was looking to write
something like this too, but this one is far more complete than mine
would have been :)

I'll have a play with it tomorrow.

Matthew.

That does look clever indeed. I guess it must be possible to extract mem
usage from there, even if i don't have a clue how right now.
