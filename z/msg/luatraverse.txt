Hi,

Here is the tool. You can implement a function that gives you the information you want and then call the function traverse passing your function as a parameter. As an example, you can look at the functions 'countreferences' and 'findallpaths'. But if these functions already gives you all the information you want... well.. that's better =) 
But it hasn't been fully tested yet. Please, report me if you find any bugs.

Thanks,
Alexandra.

You can do that in Lua itself, using some reflexive facilities. I guess
someone in the list did some tool for this. A student of mine also
wrote such tool (to traverse all live objects of a state). If she is 
not in the list, you may contact her directly:
